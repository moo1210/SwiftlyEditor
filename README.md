---
A real-time editor, across all common toolsets (including building/terrain/physics, scripting, animation, and UI) for your Roblox experience that replicates to the server instantly. Mimics Roblox Studio's interface & tools, in many ways, so it's almost just like you're inside a more lightweight version of Studio.
